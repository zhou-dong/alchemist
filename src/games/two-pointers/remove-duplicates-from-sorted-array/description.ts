export const description = `#### Description

Given an integer array **nums** sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates **in-place** 

such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. 

Then return the number of unique elements in **nums**.

---

Consider the number of elements in **nums** which are not equal to **val** be **k**, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
- Return k.
