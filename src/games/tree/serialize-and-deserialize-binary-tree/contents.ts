Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, 
or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. 
There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. 
You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
