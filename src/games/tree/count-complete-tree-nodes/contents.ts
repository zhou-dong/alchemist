export const description = `
Given the **root** of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, 
and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between **1** and **2^h** nodes inclusive at the last level **h**.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than **O(n)** time complexity.
